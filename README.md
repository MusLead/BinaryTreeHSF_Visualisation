# Binary Tree Visualisation

This Visualisation was developed by Ankit Sharma as
LearnTrees. [See the repo](https://github.com/beingmartinbmc/LearnTrees.git)

## Overview:

This project is a tool for visualizing binary trees effectively. It provides insight into how binary trees are
constructed, modified, and traversed, offering a detailed view of their structure. This tool is particularly helpful for
learning and teaching purposes, as it includes a feature set tailored to guide users through the complexities of binary
tree operations.

--------------------------------------

## Key Features:

* Visualize binary trees with clear and interactive diagrams.
* Track history changes to see how nodes are added and removed incrementally.
* Provides full modification history for analyzing the evolution of a tree structure. 
* Track individual node changes step by step. 
* Replay modifications to learn tree operations visually and intuitively.

## What Differentiates This Project:

This project introduces **real-time interaction with a history-tracking feature.**

--------------------------------------

## Optional Features in the Future Development:

+ Animation for each step in the history of tree changes. This would enable a fully interactive and visually engaging
  experience for users.
+ Dynamic resizing of the pane and nodes to prevent overlaps and maintain a clear layout, regardless of tree size.
